## New Addition; Dack Gbay Expansion
- Kodjo Egloh

## Essential
- Create a travel recommender based off of user input.

## Thought process
- The webpage theme for travel guide is the Philippines which poses a problem for api usage because the api
might not have locations specified  to the philippines. My solution to this problem was 'Dack Gbay Expansion'. 
Essentially expanding location offerings in order to accomodate the specificty of the api

## Amedous Api Used
- Tours and Activities
- Flight
- Hotels

## Locations
- Bangalore
- London
- Paris
- Berlin

## Implementation
- Multiple functions call the API based off of specifics that I coded in. For example the Bangalore Api has the
specification of the Bangalore location based off of latitudes.
- The code is essentially repetition with slight changes to accomodate seperate locations

## Design choice
- The design languages follows the same as the website. Mainly implementing flex-box for layout. Using tailwind mainly for styling
and a bit of CSS for certain sections
